                                <p>Worked as a pair to build upon some already existing visualisation, and incorporated more into the web application. This was done using JavaScript and there are different types of graphs and ways of building visualisations explored. p5.js was used as the main library.</p>

                                <p>pixelRun is an augmented reality app designed for runners. This was a team of 6 individuals working on this project. It was very focused on design and production of an app. We completed market research, testing, working in an agile environment, and more. The app is designed for runners to see coins on their trial while having a break in the middle of their run. When a preditermined amount of coins is collected, trophies are earned. The app was created to try and motivate individuals to run.</p>

                                <p>This is a hangman game created in python. It was a way for me to learn python and practice the code I was learning. The code is available to be downloaded on Github. You have to enter a secret word, and then another individual has to guess it (all completed in terminal).</p>

                                <p>This is a Java program. It uses the Levenshtein algorithm and takes a file as a command line argument and it goes through the words checking if any are not in the dictionary. It then offer the user to either enter a replacement, add the word to the dictionary, or select a word from the list of suggestions. The correct spell-checked file is stored in a different file (does not overwrite original). The code is available to be downloaded on Github.</p>
