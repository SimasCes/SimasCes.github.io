# Portfolio website

This website was developed as a personal portfolio to showcase my work. it is made from scratch and uses no JavaScript! I wanted to try push CSS and HTML as much as I oculd without JS and it worked out I did not need to use JS at all. Below are inspirations which helped me create the website, any images I used and where I got them, and any online tools.

The link https://simasces.github.io/ is used to find the portfolio.
